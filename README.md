- Containers and Container image(A container image is a binary package that encapsulates all of
the files necessary to run an application inside of an OS container)
- Docker image format
- Docker container runtime(The Docker Container Runtime
Kubernetes provides an API for describing an application deployment, but relies
on a container runtime to set up an application container using the container-
specific APIs native to the target OS. On a Linux system that means configuring
cgroups and namespaces.
The default container runtime used by Kubernetes is Docker. Docker provides an
API for creating application containers on Linux and Windows systems.)
- A Dockerfile can be used to automate the creation of a Docker container image.

- kubectl(use it to create objects and interact with the Kubernetes API.)
that apply to all Kubernetes objects
- Viewing Kubernetes API Objects(Everything contained in Kubernetes is represented by a RESTful resource)
```
EXAMPLE:Kubernetes object exists at a unique HTTP path; for example, https://your-
k8s.com/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/my-pod leads to the representation of a
pod in the default namespace named my-pod. The kubectl command makes
HTTP requests to these URLs to access the Kubernetes objects that reside at
these paths.
```
