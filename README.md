- Containers and Container image(A container image is a binary package that encapsulates all of
the files necessary to run an application inside of an OS container)
- Docker image format
- Docker container runtime(The Docker Container Runtime
Kubernetes provides an API for describing an application deployment, but relies
on a container runtime to set up an application container using the container-
specific APIs native to the target OS. On a Linux system that means configuring
cgroups and namespaces.
The default container runtime used by Kubernetes is Docker. Docker provides an
API for creating application containers on Linux and Windows systems.)
- A Dockerfile can be used to automate the creation of a Docker container image.
